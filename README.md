Small snippets of code I use to automate stuff I need

* pdf concatenator: merges all pdf files located in a specified directory into a single pdf file
* improved youtube downloader: given a playlist url, downloads all videos in that playlist. Uses multithreading to maximise speed
* backupper: copies all files and directories in a specified path to a specified output destination
